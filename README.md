This project is a Python Flask-based web application that allows users to receive and verify a One-Time Password (OTP) sent to their email. It's designed to simulate a secure user login or registration authentication process. This tool is ideal for learning how authentication flows work in web applications.

🚀 Features
Generate a secure, random 6-digit OTP

Send OTP to a user’s email using Flask-Mail

OTP expiration logic for time-based security

Simple and clean UI for entering and verifying OTP

Backend validation and error handling

Modular codebase for easy extension

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Flask – Web framework

Flask-Mail – To send OTP via email

HTML/CSS – For frontend templates

SMTP (Gmail) – For email delivery

✅ Future Improvements
Add OTP resend and retry limit features

Store OTPs securely in a database (e.g., SQLite)

Add user registration/login integration

Implement session-based or token-based auth
